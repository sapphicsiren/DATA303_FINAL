                This page was created as a final project for DATA 303, a course at the College of William and Mary.
                <br><br>
                The initial research question was: "Are there clear trends in the time and days that specific bakery items are sold?"
                <br><br>
                The data utilized comes from a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosubjeong/bakery-sales">Kaggle page</a> that contains
                the delivery sales data from a Korean bakery. The data was originally organized such that each row represents one customer’s 
                transaction, with columns: datetime, day of week, total amount (in Korean Won), customer’s location, and one column for every 
                item sold at the bakery with the associated value reflecting how much the customer bought. The data that I am interested in 
                visualizing relates to trends in items bought in relation to time and day.
                <br><br>
                To transform this data I began by dropping unnecessary rows and columns (rows: where day is NaN, columns: total amount and 
                customer location). I then replaced all the NaN values with 0, as they all represented when a customer did not buy a specific 
                product. I then melted the data so that the products were all listed in one column and the count 
                (amount purchased) was listed in an associated column. I then split the datetime column into two columns (date and time) 
                before splitting the date column into three columns (year, month, and day). Finally, I added an additional column titled 
                “Item Type” which is meant to represent the type of bakery product something is (savory pastry, sweet pastry, or drink).
                <br><br>
                This project contains a total of eight visualizations split into three groups that can be accessed by clicking
                the boxes at the upper half of the page.
