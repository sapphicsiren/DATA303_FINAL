                    This visualization displays every day of sales split by hour. 
                    The scale on the x-axis goes from 10:00 to 18:00 (10 AM to 6 PM). 
                    As these are delivery sales, it is possible for customers 
                    to place orders outside of the bakery's opening hours. 
                    <br><br>
                    Notably, there were two orders during the entirety of the data 
                    collection period that were placed after 18:00 (6 PM). The first was made
                    on October 27, 2019 at 23:02 (11:02 PM) and was an order for seven Angbutter.
                    The second was on February 19, 2020 as 22:13 (10:13 PM) and was an
                    order for one Angbutter.

                    This visualization contains the monthly sales data split by day of week. 
                    Here, we can clearly see that orders are seldom placed on Tuesday. The reason
                    for this is that, according to the data's author, the bakery is usually closed
                    on Tuesdays. 
                    <br><br>
                    It should also be noted that there are observably less sales in July 2019
                    and May 2020. This is because the data collection period spanned from July 11, 2019
                    to May 2, 2020, therefore the the end months did not have full month of data collection.
